# Way Editor

Welcome to **Way Editor**, a small framework for working with mathematical graphs. Whether you are dealing with weighted graphs, trees, or other graph types, Way Editor provides you with the tools you need to manage and manipulate graphs effectively. This project is designed for users who prefer working through a **command-line interface** (CLI).

## Features

- **Supports various graph types**: Weighted graphs, trees, and more.
- **Command-line interface**: Easy to use for quick graph creation, modification, and manipulation.
- **File management**: You can create, export, and import graph files seamlessly.
- **Multiple graph representations**:
  - **Adjacency Matrix**
  - **Edge List**
  - **Adjacency List**

## Usage

Way Editor allows you to work with graphs in three different formats for saving and exporting:
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Represents the graph as a matrix.
- **Edge List**: A list of edges defining the graph structure.
- **Adjacency List**: A list where each node is associated with a list of its adjacent nodes.
