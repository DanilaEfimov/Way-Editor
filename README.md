# Way-Editor
This is a small framework for working with mathematical graphs. It supports weighted graphs, trees, and much more. The work is done through a command-line interface. You can create, export, and import graph files. A graph can be saved in three ways: as an adjacency matrix, as an edge list, or as an adjacency list. Good luck!
